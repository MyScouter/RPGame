<p>In this game, we've implemented different concepts and used different powerful tools such as delegates, Singelton instances, UI managers, Logic managers. We've created virtual methods and generic classes and separated the use and responsibility of our scripts.</p>
<p>The player has 6 different scripts controlling different aspects of the player's functionalities. you can dig dipper into them in order to have a better understanding:</p>
